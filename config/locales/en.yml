    ranking: The team ranking page shows your best foosball partner, previous scores, percentage of won games and all the matches you played together.
    stats: The player stats contain various information about all the players. The scoring history presents the exact score and ranking of the last 100 matches. Furthermore it shows the number of won and lost games and how often the player sent an opponent crawling under the table or had to do the crawl-of-shame themselves. The highest and lowest ELO rating and the longest winning streak is shown in the stats as well.
    teams: "The random team generator helps you find a new match partner if you want to play with someone else for a change. Just pick as many players as you want out of the players list and random teams will matched up against each other."
